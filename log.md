# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Fixed a small CSS issue, re-acquainted myself with Javascript after long Python vacation, added to-do list and bare bones of save/load functionality.

**Thoughts:** One hour is too short.  May be back later.

### Day 1b: January 26, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Threw a quick webpage together to make it easier to navigate between Chrome windows.

**Thoughts:** CSS probably my biggest weakness.

### Day 2: January 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Added CRD functionality to Command Center to-do list and a modal so the user can access it.  Full CRUD functionality is probably a tomorrow problem.

**Thoughts:** I'm still not the biggest fan of Bootstrap, but I think I'm finally learning to work with it rather than against it

### Day 3: January 28, 2021

**Progress:** Wrote a quick Node.js program to automate writing these logs every day.  In fact, this very entry was written in the program.  Also finished editing capability for to-do items on Command Center.  Next up, implementing sidebar link customization.

**Thoughts:** It's fun to automate stuff.  Doesn't necessarily save much time, but I suspect there's some kind of psychological effort that's being minimized.  Might be a working memory thingâ€”automating a process means you don't need to keep the task roadmap in your head.

### Day 4: January 29, 2021

**Progress:** Command Center links are dynamically generated from a list rather than hardcoded onto the page.  Next step is to allow users to customize those arrays.

**Thoughts:** Looking forward to when all this infrastructure is set up and I can start setting up a backend with user accounts.

### Day 5: January 30, 2021

**Progress:** Link customization on Command Center is proceeding according to plan.  Biggest timesink by far was figuring out how to position "add link" button on the sidebar

**Thoughts:** It was good to have a refresher on CSS positioning.
