# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Fixed a small CSS issue, re-acquainted myself with Javascript after long Python vacation, added to-do list and bare bones of save/load functionality.

**Thoughts:** One hour is too short.  May be back later.

**Link to work:** [Command Center](https://github.com/nvanbaak/command-center)

### Day 1b: January 26, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Threw a quick webpage together to make it easier to navigate between Chrome windows.

**Thoughts:** CSS probably my biggest weakness.

**Link to Work:** [Bookends](https://github.com/nvanbaak/bookends/)

### Day 2: January 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Added CRD functionality to Command Center to-do list and a modal so the user can access it.  Full CRUD functionality is probably a tomorrow problem.

**Thoughts:** I'm still not the biggest fan of Bootstrap, but I think I'm finally learning to work with it rather than against it
